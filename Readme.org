* Container images
A good container image seems to be the ~instrumentisto/flutter~ image available from distributors like quary and docker hub
* Getting a web server running
You can simply run the given code to run a web server model that you can access from your host computer via ~localhost:3000~. With the ~--release~ tag being optional.
#+begin_src bash
flutter run --release -d web-server --web-hostname=0.0.0.0 --web-port=3000
#+end_src
